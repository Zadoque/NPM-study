# NPM Study
In this repository, you will find everything I did while learning about the Node Package Manager.

# First of all, what is NPM?
Well, NPM stands for Node Package Manager. It not only allows you to manage (install, update, lock, uninstall) the versions of packages used in your project but also enables developers to share modules as libraries. This is beneficial not just for you but for everyone.

# Requirements:
To use NPM, you need to install Node.js. Fortunately, NPM comes bundled with it by default.
Go to Node.js/Download and download it!

# NPM-study
In this repository you will see everything i did while learning about Node package manager.

First of all, What is NPM ?
Well, NPM stands for Node Package 'manager'. It not just allows you to manager (install, update, lock, unistall) the version of the packages you're using in your project but also allows develovpers to share modules as librarys. This is not just good for you, but for everybody.

# Is there others Package managers ?
Yes. What are the difference between them ? Which should you use ? 
Good question my dear friend! Let's talk about <h5 style="color: green">Yarn</h5><br><h5 style="color: green">NPM</h5>


# Requeriments:
In order to use NPM you need to install Node.js and, by default, NPM comes together.
Go to [NodeJs/Download](https://nodejs.org/pt/download) and download it!

# Firsts Steps:
After installed, all you need to do is open a folder in terminal and run `npm init`
after this, you'll see the package.json. Congrats! NPM is now helping you out!

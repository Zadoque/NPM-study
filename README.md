# NPM Study#
In this repository, you will find everything I did while learning about the Node Package Manager.

# First of all, what is NPM?#
Well, NPM stands for Node Package Manager. It not only allows you to manage (install, update, lock, uninstall) the versions of packages used in your project but also enables developers to share modules as libraries. This is beneficial not just for you but for everyone.

# Are There Other Package Managers?#
Yes. What are the differences between them? Which one should you use?
Good question! Let's discuss <h5 style="color: green">Yarn</h5>

# Requirements:#
To use NPM, you need to install Node.js. Fortunately, NPM comes bundled with it by default.
Go to Node.js/Download and download it!

# First Steps:#
After installation, all you need to do is open a folder in your terminal and run npm init. After this step, you'll see a package.json file created. Congratulations! NPM is now helping manage your project!
